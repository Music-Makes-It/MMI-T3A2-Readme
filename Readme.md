## About our project, What is Music Makes It?

**What is our purpose?**

_Music Makes it_, is an online store, where customers can safely search for and purchase music merchandise.
The purpose of _Music Makes It_, is to re-purpose the profits collected from merchandise.
Music artists have the potential to generate 10-35% of their revenue from merchandise sold at and during concerts. _Music Makes It_, is a side venture established by the team at _fake label name_ where they believe that these profits, should be put back in to the community.

The [Humpty Dumpty Foundation](https://humpty.com.au) mission is to ensure each child in the Australian hospital system have access to the correct equipment to support their treatment and recovery. For 30 years they have been providing this equipment to Pediatric Wards, Neonatal Units, Maternity and Emergency Departments in hospitals across Australia.

_Music Makes It_, is part of a growing sector of companies which include the community in their model. As consumers are increasingly becoming more aware of their product choices, their origins and affect on communities, it is important to respond to this change in our communities and assist in giving back. Our signed artists at _fake music label_ love being part of this initiative with our chosen organisation.
