## About our project, What is Music Makes It?

**What is our purpose?**

*Music Makes it*, is an online store, where customers can safely search for and purchase music merchandise.
The purpose of *Music Makes It*, is to re-purpose the profits collected from merchandise.
Music artists have the potential to generate 10-35% of their revenue from merchandise sold at and during concerts. *Music Makes It*, is a side venture established by the team at *fake label name* where they believe that these profits, should be put back in to the community.

The [Humpty Dumpty Foundation](https://humpty.com.au) mission is to ensure each child in the Australian hospital system have access to the correct equipment to support their treatment and recovery. For 30 years they have been providing this equipment to Paediatric Wards, Neonatal Units, Maternity and Emergency Departments in hospitals across Australia.

*Music Makes It*, is part of a growing sector of companies which include the community in their model. As consumers are increasingly becoming more aware of their product choices, their origins and affect on communities, it is important to respond to this change in our communities and assist in giving back. Our signed artists at *fake music label* love being part of this initiative with our chosen organisation.
